## Level4 Unit1 Part2 Listening
Today, Christina and her friend are enjoying themselves.
This morning they got up very early and drove out of San Francisco.
They crossed the Bay Bridge before the early morning commute and drove south.
Because it was so early, there were almost no cars.
After driving for an hour and a half, they stopped and had breakfast.
They ordered pancakes and coffee.
They also had some fresh fruit.
When they finished eating, it was 7 o'clock.
Then they got back into the car and drove south.
Christina wanted to listen to music, so they turned on the radio.
An hour later they stopped for gas.
They noticed that there was also a charging station for electric cars.
It's now 1:15 and they are in Yosemite Park
They have been there for two hours, since 11:15.
They are looking at Yosemite falls, which is the highest waterfall in the Park.
The water drops a total of 740 meters from the top of the upper fall to the base of the lower fall.
In another 15 minutes they planed eat lunch at a magnificent old hotel in the park.
It was built in 1927 and has a great view.
They wanted to stay there, but they couldn't get reservations.
To get a room at that hotel, you usually need to make reservations several months in advance.
They plan to stay in the park until around 4 o'clock .
By then they will have been in the park for nearly 5 hours.
Then they'll get back into the car and drive back to San Francisco.
They plan to eat dinner somewhere along the way.
If the traffic isn't too bad ,they should be back in San Francisco by 10 o'clock.
Early tomorrow morning they are going to cross the Golden Gate Bridge and go north along the coast.
From some places you can look out on the ocean and see whales and other sea life.
Christina has never seen a whale before, so she's looking forward to it.
And tomorrow night they have something special planned.
They are going to watch a baseball game.
Christina has never seen a baseball game, but she has heard that it is very popular in the US.
And the San Francisco baseball team is one of the best.
## Level4 Unit1 Part2 Vocabulary
A force is a push or a pull on an object.
A force changes the motion of a moving object.
A force can be strong or weak and it always has a direction.
The earth is a planet that goes around the sun in a circular orbit.
The speed of its motion doesn't change, but the direction of its motion does.
The earth has a layer of gas above its surface, which helps to support life.
Atoms are the building blocks of matter.
At the center of an atom is its nucleus, which has a positive electric charge.
Outside the nucleus are electrons, which have a negative charge.
Asteroids and comets, are objects that orbit our sun, but are smaller than planets.
Asteroids that pass closed to the Earth are called near-earth objects.
The layer of gases just above Earth's surface is our atmosphere.
The atmosphere is made up of gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen.
Without an atmosphere, there would be no life on Earth.
(A force can increase or decrease the speed of an object, and it can change the direction of motion)
(If they collide with Earth they could cause an extinction event).
The two lines on the left intersect each other at a right angle, which is 90 degrees.
The two lines on the right are parallel, which means they never cross.
The adjacent sides of a rectangle are perpendicular, which means they meet at a 90 degree angle.
The opposite sides of a rectangle are equal and parallel, which means they never cross.
The area of a rectangle is the length times the width.
A circle is a two dimensional figure with a radius and circumference, which is the distance around the circle.
The area of a circle is PI R squared, well(where), R is the radius and PI is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.
A sphere is a three dimensional figure with a radius and a volume, which is 4/3 PI R cubed.
All points on the surface of a sphere are equidistant from its center.
A right triangle is a two dimensional figure with 3 sides, two of which are perpendicular.
To find its area, multiply the length of the two perpendicular sides, A & B, and divided by two, A equals one half A B.
(A rectangle is a two dimensional figure with 4 sides)
(Pi is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter.)
(The electric force between the nucleus and the electrons holds the atom together.)
